# Camera_Filter

The provided code demonstrates a simple camera app using SwiftUI, Core Image, and PhotosUI frameworks. The app allows users to choose a photo from the photo library or capture an image using the device's camera. Users can then apply a sepia filter to the selected or captured image and adjust the intensity of the filter using a slider. The filtered image is displayed in real-time as the slider value changes.
